This is the repository for a GPS tracking application based on the Particle Electron Asset Tracker [HERE](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/asset-tracker).

This project consists of (3)three parts:
	
	1. Web Application - for interacting with the data recieved from the device.
	2. Device Firmware - for sending data about the device's current state STATE and GPS coordinates.
	3. Device Harware - Particle Asset Tracker and additional components
